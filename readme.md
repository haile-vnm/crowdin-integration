To achieve this, you can set up a process that periodically fetches changes from a third-party repository, such as GitHub, and then creates pull requests in AWS CodeCommit. You can use AWS Lambda along with Amazon CloudWatch Events to trigger the Lambda function every 2 minutes. Here's a high-level overview of how you can implement this:

1. **Set up an AWS Lambda Function**:
   - Create a new AWS Lambda function using the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI.
   - In the Lambda function code, write logic to fetch changes from the third-party repository and create pull requests in CodeCommit.

2. **Fetch Changes from Third-Party Repository**:
   - Use the appropriate SDK or libraries to interact with the third-party repository's API (e.g., GitHub API).
   - Extract the changes that you want to include in the pull request.

3. **Create Pull Request in AWS CodeCommit**:
   - Use the AWS SDK for CodeCommit to interact with your CodeCommit repository.
   - Create a new branch in the CodeCommit repository.
   - Push the changes fetched from the third-party repository to the new branch in CodeCommit.
   - Create a pull request in CodeCommit, specifying the source branch (newly created branch) and the target branch.

4. **Handle Errors and Logging**:
   - Implement error handling in your Lambda function to deal with potential failures during the fetch and pull request creation process.
   - Use CloudWatch Logs to log any errors or debug information for troubleshooting purposes.

5. **Testing and Deployment**:
   - Test your Lambda function thoroughly to ensure that it fetches changes and creates pull requests correctly.
   - Deploy the Lambda function to your AWS account and configure the CloudWatch Events rule to trigger it every 2 minutes.

Here's a simplified example Lambda function (Python) to give you an idea:

```python
import boto3
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # Initialize CodeCommit client
    codecommit = boto3.client('codecommit')

    # Fetch changes from third-party repository (e.g., GitHub)
    # Replace this with code to fetch changes from the third-party repository

    # Create a new branch in CodeCommit
    branch_name = 'feature-branch-' + datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d%H%M%S")
    codecommit.create_branch(
        repositoryName='your-repository-name',
        branchName=branch_name,
        commitId='HEAD'
    )

    # Push changes to the new branch in CodeCommit
    # Replace this with code to push changes to the new branch

    # Create a pull request in CodeCommit
    codecommit.create_pull_request(
        title='Pull request title',
        description='Pull request description',
        targets=[
            {
                'repositoryName': 'your-repository-name',
                'sourceReference': branch_name,
                'destinationReference': 'main'
            }
        ]
    )

    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': 'Pull request created successfully'
    }
```

Please note that you'll need to replace placeholders like `'your-repository-name'` with your actual repository name and customize the function to fit your specific requirements. Additionally, you may need to handle authentication and authorization for accessing both the third-party repository and CodeCommit.
